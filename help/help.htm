        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            <b>vtbgen</b> is a utility application made using basic Front-end web technologies. "vtbgen" is abbreviation
            for Verilog Testbench geenrator.
            <br />The <b>motivation</b> behind this app is that to test a design, written in Verilog, you have to define
            your digital signals which will be inputs.
            <br />Now, you know your inputs, you know when your input signal will be LOW, HIGH, X or Z! So instead of
            writing this information by hand
            using some text based language, why not use some graphical means to do the same?
            <br />This is exactly what this application tries to acheve.
            <br /> This application provides you a graphical interface which lets you to draw as many signal as required
            and then with one click, it generates verilog code which can be placed in <b>initial</b> block of test
            bench.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            This Section Describes how to get started with this application.
            <br /> when you open this application, first you will see <i>Fig1</i>.
            <br /> Lets add a new signal with a name <b>clock</b>. TO do this by following the steps under:
            <ul>
                <li>Goto <b>File</b></li>
                <li>Select <b>New Signal</b> from the drop down menu</li>
                <li>A pop-up will be displayed where the name of signal (it should be unique) will be entered.</li>
            </ul>
            Fig2. show the result.
            <img src="fig2.png" style="width:100%; border:2px solid black;" />
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Fig2. Clock Signal added</p>
            <br /> Now, I want to change the simulation time. There will be obvious reasons for you to do that!
            <br /> <i>Fig3.</i> shows how to change simulation time. <br />
            <img src="fig3.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;" />
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Fig3. Drop Down menu where there is an option to change
                Simulation time</p>
            <p>To Change simulation time
                <ul>
                    <li>Goto <b>Options</b> menu</li>
                    <li>Select <b>Change Simulation Time</b> </li>
                    <li>A pop up be displayed, where you will enter the required time</li>
                </ul>
                By Default, it is 100
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>*Note that, the units of the time can not be selected from here, you will have to use
                    <b>`timescale</b> compiler directive in the final verilog testbench to set the units. </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Fig4 shows the same signal as shown in Fig2 but with smaller simultion time (of 20).
            </p>
            <img src="fig4.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;" />
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Fig4. Simlation time of 20</p>
            <p>
                You can see that, changing the simulation time, changed the simulation time for all the signals
            </p>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            As the name of "clock" signal suggest, it is a clock signal, so we need to change this to a clock signal.
            You can do that by
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking on the square box on the right side of text "Clock". This selects this signal</li>
                <li>Goto <b>Edit</b> Drop Down Menu</li>
                <li>Select <b>convert to clock signal</b></li>
                <li>A Pop-up will be displayed, Enter the <b>half time period</b> of the clock signal</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="fig5.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;" />
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Fig5. Clock Signal</p>
        <p>
            Notice at the top of the signal line, you can see 1 and 0 written, these are the value of the signal at that particular instant of time.
