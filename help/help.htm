            vtbgen is a utility application made using basic Front-end web technologies. "vtbgen" is abbreviation for Verilog Testbench geenrator.
            <br/>The motivation behind this app is that to test a design, written in Verilog, you have to define your digital signals which will be inputs. 
            <br/>Now, you know your inputs, you know when your input signal will be LOW, HIGH, X or Z! So instead of writing this information by hand 
            using some text based language, why not using some graphical means to do the same? 
            <br/>This is exactly what this application tries to acheve. 
            <br /> This application provides you a graphical interface which lets you to draw as many signal as required and then with one click, it generates verilog code which can be placed in <b>initial</b> block of test bench.
